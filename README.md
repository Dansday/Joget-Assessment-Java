# Joget Assessment Java

Question 1: 

Use Java, do this coding test & print out the results in terminal:

    Variable “arrayA” is a string array of car brands: ["Honda", "Toyota", "Proton"]
    Add "Nissan" to it. Print it out.
    Add "Mazda" as the first element within the string array. Print it out.
    Now make a new variable “arrayB” which is a string array of animals. Combine both arrays into variable “arrayA”. Print it out.
    Variable “mapC” & “mapD” are both separate Map[String, String] objects of employee IDs and employee names, where:
        mapC → ["123": "Justin",  "456": "Owen", "789": "Hugo"]
        mapD → ["123": "George", "555":"Jack", "888": "Julian"]
    Combine them both into the variable “mapC” and print it out.
    Print out the reason why the result no longer has the value "Justin"?
    Return values in “mapC” where key contains "5"
    Remove map entries where the value contains the "o" character in “mapC”. (ignore case)
    I have a string variable “str” of "111222888222555". Reverse this string and assign it back to variable “str”. Print it out.
    Then, replace the last occurrence of "222" in variable “str”  with "aaa" and assign it back to variable “str”. Print it out.

Question 2:
Using Javascript. Create an array of 10 random integer numbers between 1 - 1000 and use console.log() to display each of the numbers in the array and the sum of the array.

Question 3:
Go to https://www.joget.com/, use Javascript to make the nav bar disappear. Send us the code.

Question 4: 
Using HTML and CSS, create a simple webpage layout with a header, footer, and main content section. The header should have a background color of blue and contain a centered Joget logo and a navigation menu with links to Home, About, and Contact pages.
